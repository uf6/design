# What's inside?

 - [User Experience Patterns](ux.md)
 - [Data structures & Interoperability](data.md)

# Problem

Too many graphs, too many [frameworks](https://docs.google.com/a/iilab.org/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AplklDf0nYxWdFhmTWZUc0o0SzAzMkRuMTZCUVBVeHc&usp=drive_web#gid=0), too many data structures, too many good intentions, not enough concrete technical interoperability.

Developers need reusable components, data structures and practical advice on the way to Linked Open Data without getting lost in the complexity of it. (i.e. Linked Data for the shy developer)

# Solutions

Find solutions by openly designing interoperability approaches such as:
 - Data enrichment in practice (our own user centric because its good to try and share about the hurdles)
   - How do I import CSV from Open Oil into Detective.io ? ## Add issue
   - How do I use Transparency Toolkit scrapers inside Grano?
   - How do I use the natural query display of Dataseed into the Open Oil Corporate Structure Navigator? 
   - How do I [add Industries to MEP's declarations of interest.](https://twitter.com/eucampaign/status/491276416605253632)
 - Experimenting with user experience patterns
   - How to make query building natural for investigators?
   - How can patterns be found in the graph?
   - When are tables best, when are graphs best, when are they both needed, in which proportion?...
 - Identify opportunities to use common data structures 
   - Provenance
   - Reputation
   - ...
 - Keep track of computer science development that can be applied to real world applications
   - Distributed Stores / Federated Queries
   - UI description layers
   - ...

# Data structures

We'd like standards on data that allow simple and meaningful reuse of data such as:
 - Dealing with provenance
 - Deals with key entities like organisations and people

Ideally there would be different levels of implementatin which would allow:
 - Minimum: very quick fixes that can be made to allow data sets to interoperate.
 - Core: the solid way to make data enriching predictable and repeatable
 - Extended: the cherry on top.

### Quality

 - [OpenRefine](http://openrefine.org/)
 - Exversion's [Junky](https://github.com/exversion/junky)
 - [Data Cleaning Boilerplate](https://github.com/exversion/data-cleaning-boilerplate)

### Provenance
 - __Preferred:__ [Provenance Ontology](

 - ICFJ provenance

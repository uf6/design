# Data structures

We'd like standards on data that allow simple and meaningful reuse of data such as:
 - Dealing with provenance
 - Deals with key entities like organisations and people

Ideally there would be different levels of implementatin which would allow:
 - Minimum: very quick fixes that can be made to allow data sets to interoperate.
 - Core: the solid way to make data enriching predictable and repeatable
 - Extended: the cherry on top.

### Provenance
 - Open Provenance (Ontology)
 - ICFJ provenance

### Verification

### Reputation


### Organisations/Institutions

 - [Popolo](http://popoloproject.com/) 
 
### Contracts

 - Open Contracts?
 - Open Spending?
